The main components of client-server architecture are the client and the server. The client requests services
 and resources, while the server processes the requests and manages the resources. 

 Client Interacts with the user and Requests services and resources. 

 Server Processes requests, Manages resources, Sends responses to clients, Stores and manages data, and 
 Can implement security measures like firewalls

 Benefits of client-server architecture 
 --------------------------------------

1. Scalability: Can scale up or out to handle more requests
2. Centralized management: Consolidates control of data, applications, and security
3. Security: Can be more secure than peer-to-peer networking

Other components of client-server architecture
----------------------------------------------

1. Load balancing: Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent any single server from 
becoming overwhelmed 
2. Protocol: Keeps a client-server connection until a request is completed 
3. File server: Stores information as files and provides users access
