Version control systems like Git can help developers work together more efficiently and effectively. They can
 also help with: 
1. Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each 
   other's work. 
2. Version history: Developers can easily access and compare previous versions of a project 
3. File information : Developers can see who, when, and where a file was edited 
4. Speed: Version control systems can help developers move faster 
5. Data integrity: Version control systems can help ensure that data is accurate and reliable 
6. Non-linear workflows: Version control systems can support workflows that involve many parallel branches running
 on different computers 

Distributed version control systems
-----------------------------------
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS), which means that users can access a repository from 
multiple locations. This allows developers to work on projects from multiple computers remotely.

Branching
---------
Git's branching capabilities allow developers to create isolated environments for each change to their codebase.
 This makes it easy to merge changes between branches. 

Audit trail
-----------
Version control systems can create an audit trail that shows who edited what, when, and what modifications
 were made. This can help foster accountability within a team.
